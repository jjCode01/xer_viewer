# XER Viewer  

[https://jjcode01.github.io/xer_viewer/](https://jjcode01.github.io/xer_viewer/)

Drag and drop an xer file on to the drop zone to view the schedule WBS and activities (no gantt chart, yet).  

Once the schedule is displayed you can double click an activity to view info about it.  

No real purpose for this at the moment, just messing around.
